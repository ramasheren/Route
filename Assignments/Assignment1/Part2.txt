Q1:
both for iteration
forEach only works in arrays
for of for anything iteratable
forEach simple and fast
for of for more complex operations for example continue, break, await, etc.

Q2:
Hoisting is the variables going up 
works with functions too
only declaration not assiognment
var a = 10 only var a is hoisted and undefined
temporal dead zone is the opposite of Hoisting
let and const are tdz
log a 
var a = 10
undefined
log b
let b =20
error

Q3:
== value must be equal
=== value and type must be equal

Q4:
you try an operation and if it didn't workk you catch the error
important in async ad promises so error don't go unnoticed

Q5:
type conversion is manual
Number('3') //3
string(300) //'300'
coercion happens in the background
'5'+2 //'52' number to string
'5'-2 //3 string to number
